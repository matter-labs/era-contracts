/**
 * @author Matter Labs
 * @custom:security-contact security@matterlabs.dev
 * @notice A contract used for managing nonces for accounts. Together with bootloader,
 * this contract ensures that the pair (sender, nonce) is always unique, ensuring
 * unique transaction hashes.
 * @dev The account allows for both ascending growth in nonces and mapping nonces to specific
 * stored values in them.
 * The users can either marked a range of nonces by increasing the `minNonce`. This way all the nonces
 * less than `minNonce` will become used. The other way to mark a certain 256-bit key as nonce is to set
 * some value under it in this contract.
 * @dev Apart from transaction nonces, this contract also stores the deployment nonce for accounts, that
 * will be used for address derivation using CREATE. For the economy of space, this nonce is stored tightly
 * packed with the `minNonce`.
 * @dev The behavior of some of the methods depends on the nonce ordering of the account. Nonce ordering is a mere suggestion and all the checks that are present
 * here serve more as a help to users to prevent from doing mistakes, rather than any invariants.
