/**
 * @author Matter Labs
 * @custom:security-contact security@matterlabs.dev
 * @notice The storage of this contract serves as a mapping for the code hashes of the 32-byte account addresses.
 * @dev Code hash is not strictly a hash, it's a structure where the first byte denotes the version of the hash,
 * the second byte denotes whether the contract is constructed, and the next two bytes denote the length in 32-byte words.
 * And then the next 28 bytes are the truncated hash.
 * @dev In this version of zkSync, the first byte of the hash MUST be 1.
 * @dev The length of each bytecode MUST be odd.  It's internal code format requirements, due to padding of SHA256 function.
 * @dev It is also assumed that all the bytecode hashes are *known*, i.e. the full bytecodes
 * were published on L1 as calldata. This contract trusts the ContractDeployer and the KnownCodesStorage
 * system contracts to enforce the invariants mentioned above.
