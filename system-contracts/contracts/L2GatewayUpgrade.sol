/// @dev During the upgrade process, this contract will be force-deployed onto the address of the `ComplexUpgrader` system contract, so
/// `this` will take the address of the `ComplexUpgrader`. This approach is used instead of delegate-calling `ComplexUpgrader`
/// to alleviate the need to predeploy the implementation. In the future this limitation will be removed with the new `ComplexUpgrader`

/// bytecode will be deployed back in its place.
