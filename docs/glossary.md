- **L2 batch (or just batch)** - An aggregation of multiple L2 blocks. Note, that while the API operates on L2 blocks,
  the prove system operates on batches, which represent a single proved VM execution, which typically contains multiple
  L2 blocks.
- **Facet** - implementation contract. The word comes from the EIP-2535.
- **Gas** - a unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the
