# V27 EVM emulation upgrade

## Upgrade process

V27 upgrade will happen after the gateway preparation upgrade, but before the gateway is deployed. As such the upgrade process does not involve the Gateway parts ( upgrading the CTM on GW, etc), it is an L1-only upgrade.

Additionally this is not a bridge upgrade, as the bridge and ecosystem contracts don't have new features, so L1<>L2 bridging is not affected. This means that only the system components, the Verifiers, Facets and L2 contracts need to be upgraded.

The upgrade process is as follows:

- deploy new contract implementations.
- publish L2 bytecodes
- generate upgrade data
  - forceDeployments data on L2. Contains all new System and L2 contracts.
  - new genesis diamondCut (which contains facetCuts, and genesis forceDeployments, as well as init data)
  - upgradeCut (which contains facetCuts, and upgrade forceDeployments, as well as upgrade data)
- prepare ecosytem upgrade governance calls:
  - stage 0:
    - pause gateway migrations (needed on CTM even though GW is not yet deployed)
  - stage 1:
    - upgrade proxies for L1 contracts.
    - CTM:
      - set new ChainCreationParams (-> contains new genesis upgrade cut data)
      - set new version upgrade (-> contains new upgrade cut data)
  - stage 2:
    - unpause gateway migrations
