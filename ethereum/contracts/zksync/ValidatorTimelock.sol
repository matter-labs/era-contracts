/// modifying the main zkSync contract. As such, even if this contract is compromised, it will not impact the main contract.
/// @dev zkSync actively monitors the chain activity and reacts to any suspicious activity by freezing the chain.
/// This allows time for investigation and mitigation before resuming normal operations.
/// @dev The contract overloads all of the 4 methods, that are used in state transition. When the block is committed, the
/// timestamp is stored for it. Later, when the owner calls the block execution, the contract checks that block
/// was committed not earlier than X time ago.
