/// @dev This contract is designed to streamline and enhance the user experience
/// for bridging WETH tokens between L1 and L2 networks. The primary goal of this bridge is to
/// simplify the process by minimizing the number of transactions required, thus improving
/// efficiency and user experience.
/// @dev The default workflow for bridging WETH is performing three separate transactions: unwrap WETH to ETH,
/// deposit ETH to L2, and wrap ETH to WETH on L2. The `L1WethBridge` reduces this to a single
/// transaction, enabling users to bridge their WETH tokens directly between L1 and L2 networks.
/// @dev This contract accepts WETH deposits on L1, unwraps them to ETH, and sends the ETH to the L2
/// WETH bridge contract, where it is wrapped back into WETH and delivered to the L2 recipient.
/// @dev For withdrawals, the contract receives ETH from the L2 WETH bridge contract, wraps it into
/// WETH, and sends the WETH to the L1 recipient.
/// @dev The `L1WethBridge` contract works in conjunction with its L2 counterpart, `L2WethBridge`.
