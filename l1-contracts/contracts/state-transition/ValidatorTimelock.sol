/// @notice Intermediate smart contract between the validator EOA account and the hyperchains state transition diamond smart contract.
/// @dev The primary purpose of this contract is to provide a trustless means of delaying batch execution without
/// modifying the main hyperchain diamond contract. As such, even if this contract is compromised, it will not impact the main
/// contract.
/// @dev zkSync actively monitors the chain activity and reacts to any suspicious activity by freezing the chain.
/// This allows time for investigation and mitigation before resuming normal operations.
/// @dev The contract overloads all of the 4 methods, that are used in state transition. When the batch is committed,
/// the timestamp is stored for it. Later, when the owner calls the batch execution, the contract checks that batch
/// was committed not earlier than X time ago.
