# Multi-Chain Anvil Interop Tests

End-to-end tests for ZKsync interoperability across 5 Anvil chains: L1 contract deployment, L1<->L2 bridging (ETH + ERC20), L2<->L2 interop transfers, gateway setup with chain migration, and balance tracking via L1AssetTracker.

## Chain Topology

```
┌──────────────┐
│  L1 (31337)  │  port 9545 — Bridgehub, CTM, L1AssetRouter, L1NTV, L1AssetTracker
│  settlement  │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ├──► L2  (10)  port 4050 — settled directly on L1
       │
       ├──► GW  (11)  port 4051 — gateway chain (settled on L1, settlement layer for L2A/L2B)
       │     │
       │     ├──► L2A (12)  port 4052 — settled via GW
       │     └──► L2B (13)  port 4053 — settled via GW
       │
       └──► (L2A and L2B also registered on L1 but migrated to GW)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# From contracts/l1-contracts/ — run all tests with pregenerated state (~85s)
cd contracts/l1-contracts
yarn test:hardhat:interop

# Force full deployment from scratch (~5 min)
ANVIL_INTEROP_FRESH_DEPLOY=1 yarn test:hardhat:interop

# Keep chains running after tests finish
yarn test:hardhat:interop --keep-chains
```

## Pregenerated Chain States

Tests load pregenerated Anvil snapshots from `chain-states/v0.31.0/` by default. This skips the full deployment and cuts test time from ~5 min to ~85s.

The runner auto-detects pregenerated state by checking for `chain-states/<protocol-version>/addresses.json`. If found, it decompresses the dumped state and starts each Anvil process with `--load-state`. If not found (or `FRESH_DEPLOY=1`), it runs the full 5-step deployment.

To regenerate pregenerated state after contract changes:

```bash
cd contracts/l1-contracts/test/anvil-interop
yarn setup-and-dump
```

This runs the full deployment with deterministic settings (`blockTime=0`, `timestamp=1`) and dumps each chain's state to the `chain-states/` directory.

## Running Tests Without Redeployment

After running once with `--keep-chains`, the Anvil chains and deployment state persist. Re-run just the hardhat tests:

```bash
# Run all test specs (no redeployment)
cd contracts/l1-contracts
ANVIL_INTEROP_SKIP_SETUP=1 ANVIL_INTEROP_SKIP_CLEANUP=1 \
  yarn hardhat test test/anvil-interop/test/hardhat/0*.spec.ts \
  --network hardhat --no-compile

# Run a single spec file
ANVIL_INTEROP_SKIP_SETUP=1 ANVIL_INTEROP_SKIP_CLEANUP=1 \
  yarn hardhat test test/anvil-interop/test/hardhat/02-direct-bridge.spec.ts \
  --network hardhat --no-compile

# Filter by test name with --grep
ANVIL_INTEROP_SKIP_SETUP=1 ANVIL_INTEROP_SKIP_CLEANUP=1 \
  yarn hardhat test test/anvil-interop/test/hardhat/02-direct-bridge.spec.ts \
  --network hardhat --no-compile --grep "withdraws ETH"
```

You can also add `.only` to a `describe` or `it` block in the spec file to isolate tests.

## Test Specs

| Spec                         | What it tests                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `01-deployment-verification` | L1 contracts deployed, CTM registered, all 4 L2 chains have diamond proxies, L2 system contracts present, test tokens deployed, initial chainBalance is zero |
| `02-direct-bridge`           | L1->L2 ETH deposit + L2->L1 ETH withdrawal on chain 10 (direct L1 settlement), L1AssetTracker chainBalance tracking, net flow assertions                     |
| `03-interop-transfer`        | Unsupported interop routes revert; only GW-settled L2<->GW-settled L2 interop is intentionally registered                                                    |
| `04-gateway-setup`           | GW chain contracts deployed, interop chains registered on GW L2Bridgehub, GW designated as settlement layer on L1                                            |
| `05-gateway-bridge`          | L1->L2A ETH deposit + L2A->L1 ETH withdrawal on chain 12 (via GW), L1AssetTracker chainBalance tracking, token balance migration, processLogsAndMessages     |

## Environment Variables

| Variable                       | Effect                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANVIL_INTEROP_SKIP_SETUP=1`   | Skip deployment, run only tests (requires chains already running) |
| `ANVIL_INTEROP_SKIP_CLEANUP=1` | Don't kill Anvil processes after tests                            |
| `ANVIL_INTEROP_KEEP_CHAINS=1`  | Same as `--keep-chains` flag                                      |
| `ANVIL_INTEROP_FRESH_DEPLOY=1` | Force full deployment even if pregenerated state exists           |
| `ANVIL_INTEROP_PORT_OFFSET=N`  | Offset all chain ports by N (useful for parallel runs)            |

## Debugging

Every transaction hash in the test output is printed as a `cast run` command:

```
L1 tx: cast run 0x9eb4...acf83 -r http://127.0.0.1:9545
L2 bridgeBurn tx: cast run 0x4856...736d6 -r http://127.0.0.1:4050
```

Copy-paste into a terminal (while chains are still running) to get the full execution trace.

## Limitations & Deviations from Production

### Not Supported

- **L1→L2 transaction failures / refundRecipient**: Priority requests always succeed on Anvil; failure + refund logic is untested
- **Batch settlement**: No real sequencer or prover; batches are never committed/proved/executed
- **Custom pubdata pricing**: Gas and pubdata costs use Anvil defaults, not ZKsync fee models
- **L1→GW→L2 relay**: GW-settled ETH deposits stay on the priority-request path for both hops: L1→GW via `NewPriorityRequest`, then GW→L2 via nested `NewPriorityRequest` events extracted from the GW relay receipt. `InteropBundleSent` is only used for real L2↔L2 interop flows

### Mock Contracts

Source of truth for the Anvil predeploy layout lives in
`src/core/predeploys.ts` via `PREDEPLOY_SYSTEM_CONTRACTS`.

| Mock                        | Address   | Replaces              | Difference                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `MockL2MessageVerification` | `0x10009` | L2MessageVerification | All proof checks return `true`                       |
| `MockL1MessengerHook`       | `0x7001`  | L1_MESSENGER_HOOK     | No-op; real L1MessengerZKOS still emits events       |
| `MockMintBaseTokenHook`     | `0x7100`  | MINT_BASE_TOKEN_HOOK  | No-op; L2BaseToken pre-funded via `anvil_setBalance` |
| `DummyL1MessageRoot`        | L1        | L1MessageRoot         | All proof verification returns `true`                |

Real contracts used: `SystemContext` at `0x800b`, `L1MessengerZKOS` at `0x8008`, `L2BaseTokenZKOS` at `0x800a`, all other L2 system contracts at their production addresses.

### L2 Deployment: `anvil_setCode` + Real Genesis Upgrade

Contracts are placed at hardcoded addresses via `anvil_setCode` (production has them in genesis state). The real genesis upgrade calldata from L1's `GenesisUpgrade` event is relayed to L2, initializing all contracts via `initL2()` with production-identical data.

### Impersonation

| What                          | Who                          | Production equivalent                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Genesis upgrade relay         | `L2_FORCE_DEPLOYER_ADDR`     | Bootloader executes upgrade tx        |
| Interop chain registration    | L1 `ChainRegistrationSender` | Real L1 service-tx flow relayed to L2 |
| GW chain registration         | `ChainAssetHandler`          | Governance flow                       |
| Settlement layer notification | `L2_BOOTLOADER_ADDR`         | Bootloader at batch start             |
| Governance calls              | Governance contract          | Multi-sig / timelock                  |
| GW L2Bridgehub ownership      | Aliased CTM governance       | Shared governance from deployment     |

### Other Shortcuts

- **GW L2Bridgehub ownership transfer**: CTM deploys a per-chain Governance, but `fullRegistration` sends from ecosystem Governance. The test transfers ownership before relay.
- **Interop registration scope**: the harness only intentionally registers GW-settled L2 chains for interop. Routes involving the gateway chain or a direct-settled chain revert in the harness.
- **Synthetic merkle proofs**: Encode settlement layer chain ID but contain no real cryptographic data
- **Interop proofs**: Correct struct shape but empty proof arrays
- **v29 -> v31 upgrade harness**: [run-v29-to-v31-upgrade-test.ts](/Users/kalmanlajko/programming/zksync/zksync-era2/contracts/l1-contracts/test/anvil-interop/run-v29-to-v31-upgrade-test.ts) still applies direct `anvil_setStorageAt` patches to legacy chain state before per-chain upgrade. This is a test-only compatibility bridge, not a production upgrade flow.
- **Temporary upgrade inputs**: the upgrade harness copies v29 config inputs into `test/anvil-interop/outputs/upgrade-harness-inputs/` and passes them to Forge via env overrides. It no longer mutates checked-in `upgrade-envs/.../local.toml`.

## Cleanup

```bash
# Full cleanup: kill chains, remove outputs, reset state
cd contracts/l1-contracts/test/anvil-interop
yarn cleanup
```
