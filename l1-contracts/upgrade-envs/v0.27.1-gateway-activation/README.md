# Gateway activation PR

This ZIP did not introduce any protocol changes, only an activation of the ZK Gateway settlement layer. This code comes after the previous [v27-evm](../v0.27.0-evm/) ZIP.

The configs should be roughly identical to the ones in v27, but also contain some additional fields. An example can be seen in the [stage.toml](./stage.toml).
