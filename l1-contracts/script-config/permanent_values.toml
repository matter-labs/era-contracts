# Legacy Gateway configuration for settlement layer validation
# This section contains historical data about chains that settled on the legacy Gateway
[legacy_gateway]
# The chain ID of the legacy Gateway (9075 for mainnet)
chain_id = 9075

# Historical migration intervals for chains that used the legacy GW
# Each entry represents a chain that settled on the legacy GW before V31
# Format: chain_id, migrate_to_sl_batch, migrate_from_sl_batch
# Note: migrate_from_sl_batch = 0 means the chain hasn't migrated back yet
# These values should be filled in before V31 deployment based on actual historical data
# Example for Era on mainnet (chain_id = 270):
# [[legacy_gateway.chain_intervals]]
# chain_id = 270
# migrate_to_sl_batch = 0  # Set to actual batch number when Era migrated to legacy GW
# migrate_from_sl_batch = 0  # Set to actual batch number when Era migrated back (0 if still on GW)
