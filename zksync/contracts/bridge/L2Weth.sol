/// @notice The canonical implementation of the WETH token.
/// @dev The idea is to replace the legacy WETH9 (which has well-known issues) with something better.
/// This implementation has the following differences from the WETH9:
/// - It does not have a silent fallback method and will revert if it's called for a method it hasn't implemented.
/// - It implements `receive` method to allow users to deposit ether directly.
/// - It implements `permit` method to allow users to sign a message instead of calling `approve`.
///
/// Note: This is an upgradeable contract. In the future, we will remove upgradeability to make it trustless.
/// But for now, when the Rollup has instant upgradability, we leave the possibility of upgrading to improve the contract if needed.
